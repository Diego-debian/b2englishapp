## Objective
Frontend confirmation of Tense Reference Pages (12/12) and Practice Page UI Enhancements.

## 1. Tenses Audit (Grammar Reference)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Scope:** Replicated Present Simple template across all time blocks.

### Present Time
- [x] Present Simple (`/tenses/present-simple`)
- [x] Present Continuous (`/tenses/present-continuous`)
- [x] Present Perfect (`/tenses/present-perfect`)
- [x] Present Perfect Continuous (`/tenses/present-perfect-continuous`)

### Past Time
- [x] Past Simple (`/tenses/past-simple`)
- [x] Past Continuous (`/tenses/past-continuous`)
- [x] Past Perfect (`/tenses/past-perfect`)
- [x] Past Perfect Continuous (`/tenses/past-perfect-continuous`)

### Future Time
- [x] Future (Will) (`/tenses/will`)
- [x] Future (Going to) (`/tenses/going-to`)
- [x] Future Continuous (`/tenses/future-continuous`)
- [x] Future Perfect (`/tenses/future-perfect`)

**Verification:**
- All pages load correct distinct content.
- Template structure is identical (Header -> Carousel -> Navigation).
- **Language Constraint:** All visible text checked and confirmed English-only.
- **Mini-Practice:** All pages contain interactive 5-question set.

## 2. Practice Page Audit
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**File:** `frontend/app/practice/page.tsx`

**Desktop Layout Fix:**
- Grid changed to `minmax(0,1fr) 360px` split.
- Gap reduced to `gap-6` (improved from default).
- Sidebar width fixed at `360px`.
- Result: "Compact premium" feel achieved on large screens.

**Mobile Stability:**
- Default `grid-cols-1` preserved.
- Stacked layout verified (Mobile-first approach).

**Functional Check:**
- Classic Mode: Render logic intact.
- Millionaire Mode: Render logic intact.
- No backend/logic changes applied.

## 3. Build Verification
**Command:** `npm run build`
**Result:** ✅ PASS
- No TypeScript errors.
- No linting errors.
- Static generation successful for all tense routes.

## 4. Final Conclusion
The frontend is stable and fully populated with the "Grammar Reference" content. The Practice UI is polished for desktop while maintaining mobile compatibility.

**Ready for deployment/merge.**

## 5. Next Actions (Planned)
- [ ] **Integrate Grammar Tenses with Practice:** Map existing Practice activities to specific Tense pages to enable "Apply in practice" contextuality.
- [ ] **Mini-Practice Feedback:** Enhance frontend feedback for mini-practice widgets (e.g., sound effects, animations) to increase engagement.
- [ ] **Onboarding:** Design and implement a proper Landing/Onboarding flow for new users.
- [ ] **Support/Donations:** Add a lightweight "Buy me a coffee" or support page (frontend implementation).
- [ ] **UX Polish:** Gather early usage feedback to refine layouts and spacing further.
