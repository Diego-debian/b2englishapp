# Task 11.5: Admin Content List Polish

## Overview
This task enhances the "Admin Content List" view (`/admin/content`) by applying design system tokens for filters, table containers, and empty states, guarded by `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_UI_V11`.

## Changes

### 1. `lib/designSystem.ts`
- Added `ds.filter` token group (group, active, inactive) for tab-like filter buttons.
- Added `ds.table.container` for standardizing table borders and shadows.
- Verified `ds.state.empty` usage.

### 2. `components/admin/ContentList.tsx`
- Applied `ds.filter` tokens to the status filter buttons.
- Applied `ds.table.container` to the table wrapper.
- Applied `ds.state.empty` to the internal table empty state (when filters return no results).
- Preserved legacy styling when flag is OFF.

## Verification

### Feature Flag: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_UI_V11`
- **Default**: `false` (OFF).

### Checklist

1.  **Build Verification**:
    - [ ] `npm run build` passes.

2.  **Manual Verification (Flag OFF)**:
    - [ ] Visit `/admin/content`.
    - [ ] Filters should look like gray/dark pills.
    - [ ] Table should have standard borders.
    - [ ] Empty state should be simple text.

3.  **Manual Verification (Flag ON)**:
    - [ ] Enable flag in `.env.local`.
    - [ ] Visit `/admin/content`.
    - [ ] **Filters**: Should look cleaner, potentially white active tab with shadow (if `ds` defined so).
    - [ ] **Table**: rounded corners, subtle shadow.
    - [ ] **Empty State**: dashed border box with icon inside the table row.

## Risks
- **Table Layout**: The empty state box inside a table cell might be constrained by the cell's padding. Tested to ensure it flows reasonably.
